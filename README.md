A shell is a program that serves as an intermediary between the user and the operating system. It facilitates user interaction with the operating system by receiving and interpreting commands entered by the user, verifying their correctness, and executing them. Shells provide a user interface for utilizing computer resources, including memory. Shells can come in two primary forms: a command-line interface, such as Bash, or a graphical user interface, like Microsoft Windows Office.

Step 1: Grasp the Fundamental Concepts

Before embarking on the development of your own shell, it's essential to grasp the foundational concepts of shell operation. You should be familiar with concepts such as input and output processes, file descriptors, and system calls. At system startup, three fundamental data streams are established: stdin, stdout, and stderr.
